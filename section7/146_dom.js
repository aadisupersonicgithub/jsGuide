// js is hosted lang
// code gets parsed and rendered by Browser , gives object to interact with this parse HTML (aka DOM) document object model
// DOM also exist outside browser (eg not in server inbuilt, but packages can do that too html->DOM)
// brwoser exposes web apis (document, window) to allow js to work with parsed document

// document : root dom node (from where we can access entire)
// + provides access to element query, dom content etc

// window : exposes what brwoser provides to user, ie global stroage for script, window specific properties/methods eg screen width
// + active brwoser window / tab
